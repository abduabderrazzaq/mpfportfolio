									<h2>The Getaway</h2>

									<p>
									High school. It is the final encore of everyone’s youth. The encompassing portal to the real world of adulthood. While the bells take an eternity to ring, one class period fills the void between years to  becomes a time of freedom and exploration. Let us all agree that everyone likes summer vacation. Hmm, no. Like is too week. Everyone cherishes vacation. People are always talking about what extravagant trip they have planned or that they’re gonna halo back into a bean bag and “chill” with friends.
									</p>
									<p>
									When the rainfall slowed down and lockers emptied, everyone went into summer knowing who they were is this world and what they were gonna do Senior year and beyond. I on the other hand, had no idea what I wanted to do and who I wanted to be. I had my shoelace grilled into the escalator and was such as the top, my feet being choked from getting off. I was sure that I would find myself getting wrenched under the steps and dragged back down. There were no friends standing at the top grasping my arms and forcing me out. There was no escape route where I could get out, because the closing number was running up the playlist. Under the escalator lied a pitch black alley way where the shadowy figures overran my legs and pinned me to the bottom.
									</p>
									<p>
									In swoops in the real life Batman himself, my father. My dad is that person who somehow, no matter what the situation, knows exactly what to say and exactly how to act. It is quite bizarre, however very wonderful and impressive at the same time. In my house, he isn’t just one room next door to mine. No. He is always off saving the world some three thousand miles away in the Golden State itself, California.  Having not seen my father in many months, we set out for an adventure into nature that would open up my mind for thinking of new ideas.
									</p>
									<p>
									A brief car ride south of Boston felt like days. The bubbling rubber tires on the car cooled down with the ocean breeze and the light cobblestone roads. Many years have passed since I last returned to the summer spot that my eyes videos. I was back in Newport Rhode Island. A speedy race around the coast lands us at the summer home we always dream of staying at.
									</p>
									<p>
										Seagulls cry in the distance under the glow that fills the sky. The waves clash in a fight for the rocks out in the ocean as their echoes race through the hallways. My body endlessly falls into a plush couch facing the front door. Through the door the golden yellow sun beams down from overhead, lightly stinging the grass in the front yard. The light gets caught by the door and leaves a shadow inside the house. The pitch black cuts off at my The white floor tiles spring out a cool feeling with every step of my sand impaired bare feet. My hands find the glass door and nudge it open to let in the heat from outside. As the door zooms shut behind me, I step onto the plain grey sidewalk. The sidewalk is raised from the bubbling black asphalt cooking under the sun. A rectangular prism of light fills my eyes and covers the house behind me. I reach to my head, however all I feel is my long straight hair. “Damn!” My eyes squint in frustration to the blankness on my head. No raybans. I think about going back inside, though I object to the effort and turn back to the light. I close my eyes and the warmth covers my face in a bright glow. It feels nice and relaxing. I could stand here for hours. As the clouds skip through the sky, the lights grows softer, turning to a heavenly white sheet of nothing. My foot reaches a drop and I lower my leg to the step below. The angle of the light changes, and a small canopy hides my head from the sun.
									</p>
									<p>
									Another step down and I am at the bottom where the grey path cascades into the abyss of asphalt. The rough black tarr scraps my feet with every step. My heels take the abuse like nothing as they have been lost feeling from being in the scorching sand. As The asphalt ends, a stone wall plummets down to the the rocks where the water continues its fight. My eyes reach over the edge of the wall and grab the rocks tight. My feet curl around the top edge of the wall and leans my body towards the horizon. With a slight bend in my knees, my body rockets forward over the rocks and dives into the crisp blue water. After a few seconds my head rips out of the water and my hair whips around spitting water around my head. “Whoo whoo” spills out of my mouth after the teal salt water spits out.
