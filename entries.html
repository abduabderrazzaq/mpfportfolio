									<h2>My theme Song</h2>

									<p>
									“Be Somebody” by boyce Avenue would be the theme song of my life. This song builds a story that in many ways relates to my personal experience. With a few chords on the guitar, the song opens with “My head feels tangled up like the headphones in my pocket.” For a few years now, I’ve been struggling to figure out what I want to do with my life and I should approach my goals. In my first couple years of high school, I struggled a little with grades and I would always find myself “tangled up.” What tangled me was all the work I had and the expectations from my parents and friends that come with it. When my grandfather and uncle both past away, I began separating myself from my friends and my school work took a drive off a cliff. “I’m clinging to old news, Memories I’m scared to lose.” I couldn’t forget the tragedy that struck my family which took a toll on my whole life. My grades dropped and I became even less social with others. One day my father sat down with me for a while and repeatedly said I needed to become someone and get known in the world. That I needed to open up the curtains of the house and let some new light in. I slowly got back on my feet, and with time, regained my confidence and will to work. Today I strive to still “Be Somebody,” by always thinking of new possibilities and doing anything that has not already been done by someone else.

									<h2>A New President</h2>

									<p>
										There are footsteps in the distance. The clapping of the heels against the barren concrete floors grows louder until it reaches the doors. The figure stops, glances at the doors for a second and starts stepping back. The figure eventually stops and begins again towards the doors. As its shadow leans against the blue doors, the figure’s arms spring out and fling the door outwards. The figure steps in the room, the floor is carpeted and the wall is well lit. The figure stands tall and continues down the walkway. His sweater is thin, yet its very warm. His head faces forward. Never leaving sight of the stage. As the figure passes by the rows and rows of seats filled, a smile emits from his face. Everyone’s heads are moving with their eyes glued in virtual reality. The figure approaches the stages and steps up to a giant screen. Everyone removes their headsets, the demo is now over. The audiences turns and looks up the the figure just as it’s about to speak. He looks around and says “so what did you think?” Everyone applauded and the man smiles. Mark Zuckerberg.

									<h2>Ascending</h2>

									<p>
										A sharp vibration ripples through the ship, and a violent screech yells through the hallways. The docking clam releases, and the Federation vessel flows back into space. The engines begin to whir and thrust a burst of flying sparks and yellow flames. The ship maneuvers back, turning to face beyond. As the saucer rises in the vacuum of space, its lights flicker for awareness. The ship rolls slightly to the right, but the jets fire to push it back. As the disk rolls back to its even position, the sun rises its reflections off the silver metal plates which reveals the thick anodized black text spread around the hull. The lights continue blinking and the ship roars with a  pop of its thrusters. The engines light up, and an electronic beep echoes through the ship's interior. Up overhead, a cloud of rock, ice and dust, forms a film over the ship's head. Above the cloud sits a massive planet lined with many colors. Saturn. The dust begins to rise, and a disk emerges from the residue. It’s lights grow stronger and the dust escapes the hull, finally revealing a call sign. NCC-1701. More text emerges in Saturn's rings, U.S.S Enterprise. The light glistens past the letters to the central eye of the disk. A small bulge remains opaque until it quickly flashes clear. A man stands behind the glass, dressed in a yellow shirt. On his left chest side there sits an emblem, The Federation of Planets.

									<h2>Nervous</h2>

									<p>
										A pencil lies on the darkening pointer finger of a boys right hand. His pa,s face up into the ceiling, every crease and line outlined under the light. The boys hands glow a gentle red, darkening his lightly tanned skin. His fingers are spaced apart from one another and twitch every few seconds. Dots appear out of a few creases in his palm. The light forces them out letting the sweat fill the channels in is hand. The boys hands start to vibrate, pushing the sweat down the rivers of his palm to his wrist. The pencil starts to slide down the wall of his right middle finger, until his fidgeting point finger nudges the pencil back up.

									<h2>Jobs</h2>

									<p>
										The room was quiet, everyone's eyes stared at one man on stage. Apple co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs was reaching into his pocket. His hand fiddled around a bit until his arm froze and retracted. Some people in the audience stood. Others leaned forward and just stared into a deep void. From his worn blue jean pocket emerged a black bar followed by a silver block that carried an apple logo in a lightly shaded grey. A dot in the upper left hand corner turned many heads. Once it was fully unveiled, everyone froze. It appeared to be just another ipod. One in black plastic and metal with a new camera. Job’s raised the device in his hand and point its logo towards the audience. With his other hand, he turned the back to reveal a black front screen. His pointer finger nudged a button and the bezel lit up with squares of different colors. The iphone. Everyone stood up and applaud. -- 1/9/17 --  “Steve Jobs introduced the Iphone 10 years ago today.”
